In the passing 2 months(Aug-Oct, 2021), core team has been called up to start working on architecture design and conceptual ideas. The following foundationis have been built up within this period:

1. The architecture design document and github repo setup
2. Two "steathy" social media channels were setup and started to collect relevant topic the same time tagged 2000+ different coverages
3. An demo version of data-drive censorship graph has been created by team (yet to publish to community)

Todos:
1. First MVP(Minimal Viable Product) of censorship graph will be released to github community and call community participation
2. Connect censorship graph with existing content on GFWBlog and hopefully, some CDT web site content, in a visual way. 
3. Link early community contributions with credits to prepare for future token reward.
